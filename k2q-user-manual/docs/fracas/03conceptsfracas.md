## FRACAS Concepts

While FRACAS is an indutry recognized and widely used approach, there is no single standard on how to implement a FRACAS system. As such, FRACAS is very much a concept in it's own right. The problem with this is that many offerings on the market today give you so much freedom to the extent that it is not clear whether the implementation is correct. The following section explains the underlying concepts that FRACAS is based on, and these can be considered the requirements that a system must satisfy to be able to be called a FRACAS system.

### Centralized Incident Database

FRACAS requires a centralized incident database. Every incident is recorded into the incident database using the same format, regardless of where it originated from within the business.

This is important to be able to take a holistic view of problems within a business to identify potential cause and effect relationships. The centralized incident database makes this possible through consistent data collection and reporting across all business functions, giving visibility of the inter-dependancies within cause and effect problem chains. In other words, problems can happen in the link between processes, and you have to understand the relationship between those processes to notice this effectively. This concept is also critical to ensure that any corrective actions that are implemented in one area do not create a subsequent problem in another area, and if that does happen we can quickly identify the root cause. 

### Closed Loop

FRACAS is a 'closed loop' system. This concept describes a process that is a cycle, which is created by a feedback loop from the output back to the input. For example, the process may be triggered by an incident report from a customer, it means that at the end of the process we need to have come full circle back to address the problem for the customer. So we can further say that 'closed loop' means providing **Customer Focus**. In short, the ouput of the process (corrective and preventative measures) must feedback to and be in the best interest of the customer (who is the input to the process).
