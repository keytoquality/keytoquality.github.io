## What is FRACAS?

'FRACAS' is an acronym that stands for 'Failure Reporting, Analysis and Corrective Action System'. It basically does what it says on the tin, but there are some important concepts that go along with this type of system.

## FRACAS Concepts

### Centralized Incident Database

'FRACAS' is a system that depends on a centralized incident database. Every incident is recorded into it using the same format. Incidents can occur in any area of a business such as:
* Customer Service
* Manufacturing
* Engineering and Development

As such it's important to take a holistic view of problems within a business to be able to identify potential cause and effect relationships. The centralized incident database makes this possible through consistent data collection and reporting across all business functions, giving visibility of the inter-dependancies within cause and effect problem chains. Another benefit of this approach is to ensure that any corrective actions that are implemented in one area do not create a subsequent problem in another area. 

### Closed Loop

'FRACAS' is defined as a 'closed loop' system. Let's explore what that means. The process is triggered by an incident report from a customer; the customer can be internal or external (read about this **concept**). When we define this is a 'closed loop' process, it means that at the end of the process we need to have come full circle back to the customer. So we can further say that 'closed loop' means providing **Customer Focus**. In other words, the ouput of the process (corrective and preventative measures) must feedback and be in the best interest of the customer (who is the input to the process).
