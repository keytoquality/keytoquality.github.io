## Field Name Definitions

*K2Q* has been designed at the top level with generic field names to accommodate all industry applications and allow you to start using the software straight away with zero setup. This section explains what each field name is used for, and offers some industry specific suggestions. However, it is possible to apply templates within *K2Q* to change the field labels seen on the screen if required.
