## K2Q Core Concepts

This section introduces the core concepts of the *K2Q* system. Individual modules may have specific theory and conceptual information (such as field names and relevent usages) which can be found in the corresponding sections of the reference guide.

## Customer Focus

Quality Management Systems are often focused on the management of documentation and certification. While this provides an important and neccessary function to an organisation, this does not neccesarily translate into an improved experience for the customer.

> Translate data into actions

One of the foundational concepts of the *K2Q* system is that every module is designed to provide customer focus. Customer focus means putting your customer's requirements first. Everytime data is collected, collated and analysed with K2Q, it is done with the purpose of creating an output that can be translated into action. This is a key factor in enabling continuous improvement.

> Continuous Improvement refers to an ongoing cycle of incremental improvements that continuously drives customer satisfaction and business excellence to higher standards.


In modern, contemporary organisations, everyone is responsible for maintaining quality standards to some degree. As such, customers can be internal as well as external. This is another important concept behind the design of the *K2Q* system, to promote an internal culture of quality which is in turn translated externally for the benefit of the consumer.

## Workflows

> Workflows are the way we get things done

Whether we are aware or not, when we perform a series of sequential steps to achieve a particular end result, we are carrying out a workflow. You can think of a workflow as the same concept as a process or procedure. Well designed workflows and carrying them out consistently are both critical factors to success. This is also another key factor that enables continuous improvement through standardized approaches.

At the heart of the *K2Q* system is our powerful workflow engine. You'll come across these carefully designed workflows in all of our modules, and they all have the same key features:

#### Completion and Approval Gates

Workflows are based on sequential steps that must be completed in order. In an ideal world this is a great concept, but in reality many activities such as problem solving rarely follows a set course, and often multiple activities are carried out in parallel. 

*K2Q* workflows allow information to be recorded at any step of the process at any time. Between each step is a gate that requires the current step to be completed and approved before the status of the workflow can continue to the next step. While step gates are nothing new, our simple tweak empowers the team to take action and generate ideas without being constrained by the boundaries of the process.

## Worklogs

> The power of conversation

Conversations are a powerful tool to collaborate, request, share and challenge information. Because conversations are fluid and occur naturally, they can often be the key driving force behind a process. It's the human touch, which can sometimes be lost in complex processes. On the other hand, complex processes can be impossible to manage through a conversation based system alone; for example, scrolling through a large chat history searching for a single piece of information is inefficient.

Worklogs are a novel feature of *K2Q* and you'll find them alongisde most workflows. This is where the conversation happens. The workflow captures the required data while the worklog provides the context. The worklog is tied to each step of a workflow, so you can quickly locate and join conversations of interest.


## RACI

'RACI' is an acronym that stands for 'Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed'. It's an industry standard way of defining team member roles. In *K2Q* the 'RACI' concept is applied in team based workflows such as problem solving. Study the below example:

| Workflow Step | Person A  | Person B   |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Step 1  | Responsible | Accountable |
| Step 2        | Informed         | Informed          |

> In the above example, the 'RACI' matrix shows that for the first step of the workflow, **Person A** is 'Responsible' and **Person B** is 'Accountable'. That means **Person A** is required to update and complete the information for this step, while **Person B** is required to sign off and approve it. However in the second step both persons have the 'Informed' requirement, which means they don't have any deliverables but still need to be kept in the loop.
