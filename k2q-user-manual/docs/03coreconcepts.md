## K2Q Core Concepts

This section introduces the core concepts of the K2Q system as a whole. Individual modules may have more specific theory and conceptual information (such as field names and relevent usages) which can be found in the corresponding sections of the reference guide.

## Customer Focus

Quality Management Systems are often focused on the management of documentation and certification. While this provides an important and neccessary function to an organisation, this does not neccesarily translate into an improved experience for the customer.

> Translate data into actions

One of the foundational concepts of the K2Q system is that every module is designed to provide customer focus. Everytime data is collected, collated and analysed, it is done with the purpose of creating an output that can be measured and actioned against. This is one factor that enables a continuous improvement cycle to happen, the concept of incremental improvements that drive customer satisfaction and business excellence to higher standards.

You don't have to work in the quality profession to gain benefit from using K2Q either. In modern, contemporary organisations, everyone is responsible for maintaining quality standards. Relationships within an organisation can be recognised as customer relationships too. As such, the responsibility often falls to stakeholders outside of an organisation's quality department to participate in quality assurance and control measures. To this effect, Manufacturing, Engineering, Design and Operations leaders who may not have a particular background in quality can also benefit from using K2Q.

**The maximum quality of service level achievable for external customers is dependant on the quality of service level achieved for internal customers.** Many organisations fail to notice or address this problem, and this is where there is a huge gap in traditional quality management systems. K2Q fills that gap.

## Workflows

> Workflows are the way we get things done. 

Whether we are aware about it or not, whenever we perform a series of sequential steps to achieve a particular end result, we are carrying out a workflow. You can think of a workflow as the same concept as a process or procedure. Well designed workflows and carrying them out consistently are both critical factors to success. This is the other factor that enables continuous improvement through a standardized approach. 

At the heart of the K2Q system is our powerful workflow engine. You'll come across these carefully designed workflows in all of our modules, and they all have the same key features:

#### Completion and Approval Gates

Workflows are based on sequential steps that must be completed in order. In an ideal world this is a great concept, but in reality many activities such as problem solving rarely follows a set course, and often multiple activities are carried out in parallel. This is where completion and approval gates come in. 

K2Q workflows allow information to be recorded at any step of the process at any time. But between each step is a gate that requires the current step to be completed and approved before the actual status of the workflow can continue to the next step. While step gates are nothing new, our simple tweak empowers the team to take action and generate ideas without being constrained by the boundaries of the process.
