## Overview

K2Q is a cloud based quality management system. It's comprised of seperate modules, which each perform specific functions related to different areas within the subject of Quality Management. K2Q is the product of painstaking development by a team of quality professionals with years of industry experience, to bring a system that provides a simple and straightforward platform for implementing complex quality processes into day to day business operations. The modules can be implemented as standalone programs or in combination with each other, which provides some unique integrated features.

## Customer Focus

Quality Management Systems are often focused on the management of documentation. While this provides an important and neccessary function to a business, this does not neccesarily translate into an improved experience for the customer. K2Q has been designed with bringing the customer focus back, providing the framework and structure you need to carry out best business practices, while giving you the power to implement and control robust quality processes that directly translate into improved customer satisfaction and business excellence.

You don't have to work in the quality profession to gain benefit from using K2Q either. Often the responsibility for implementing quality assurance and control tasks fall to stakeholders outside of an organisation's quality department. In modern, contemporary organisations everyone is responsible for maintaining quality standards. To this effect, Manufacturing, Engineering and Design teams can also benefit from the functions K2Q can provide.

## Workflows

At the heart of the K2Q system is our powerful workflow engine. Workflows are the way we get things done. Anytime we perform a series of steps to achieve an end result we are carrying out a workflow.

## Modern UX / Design

K2Q is a cut above the rest when it comes to user experience. 

## System Requirements

Internet connection and web browser. That's it. K2Q works across any platform. No special hardware or software requirements needed.
